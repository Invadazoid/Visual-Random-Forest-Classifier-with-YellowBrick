In this project, the performance of a random forest classifier on the Poker Hand data set is evaluated using visual diagnostic tools from Yellowbrick. 

With an emphasis on visual steering of our analysis, the following topics have been covered in the machine learning workflow: feature analysis, feature importance, algorithm selection, model evaluation using regression, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
